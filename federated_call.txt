1. Why Use Spark for Scoring in Dataiku?
Parallel Processing: Distributes computation across multiple nodes.
Scalability: Handles large datasets efficiently without memory bottlenecks.
Optimized I/O: Works well with big data formats like Parquet.
2. Steps to Implement Spark-Based Scoring in Dataiku
Step 1: Enable Spark for Your Dataiku Job
Ensure that your Dataiku instance is configured to use Spark.
Choose "Spark" as the execution engine in Dataiku's recipe settings.
Step 2: Load Your Pickled Model
Since your model is serialized with pickle, you'll need to broadcast it to Spark workers so they can use it in distributed UDFs.

python
Copy
Edit
import pickle
import dataiku
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf, col
import pandas as pd

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()

# Load the model
with open("/path/to/model.pkl", "rb") as f:  # Store the model in a Dataiku managed folder
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Broadcast the model to all worker nodes
broadcast_model = spark.sparkContext.broadcast(model)
Step 3: Define a Spark UDF for Batch Prediction
Since Spark DataFrames do not directly support sklearn models, define a Pandas UDF.

python
Copy
Edit
@pandas_udf("double")  # Adjust return type based on your model's output
def predict_udf(features: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
    model = broadcast_model.value  # Access the broadcasted model
    return pd.Series(model.predict(features.to_list()))  # Ensure input is in the right format
Step 4: Load and Process Data in Spark
Read the input dataset as a Spark DataFrame.
Apply the prediction function.
python
Copy
Edit
# Load input dataset from Dataiku as Spark DataFrame
input_dataset = dataiku.Dataset("input_dataset")
df_spark = input_dataset.get_dataframe(spark=True)  # Load directly as Spark DataFrame

# Apply prediction
df_spark = df_spark.withColumn("predictions", predict_udf(col("features_column")))

# Save output dataset back to Dataiku
output_dataset = dataiku.Dataset("output_dataset")
output_dataset.write_with_schema(df_spark.toPandas())  # Convert Spark DF to Pandas before saving
3. Optimizations for Faster Scoring
Use Parquet Instead of CSV

Parquet is optimized for Spark and reduces I/O time.
python
Copy
Edit
df_spark.write.format("parquet").save("output_dataset")
Adjust Partitioning for Better Parallelism

Spark processes data in partitions; ensure your dataset is well-partitioned.
python
Copy
Edit
df_spark = df_spark.repartition(10)  # Adjust based on cluster size
Use Dataiku's Spark SQL for Performance Gains

If your model supports SQL-based transformations, consider in-database scoring.
4. When to Use Spark in Dataiku
Your dataset is too large to fit in memory (millions of rows).
You are running Dataiku on a distributed cluster (Hadoop, Databricks, etc.).
Your model is batch-scoring friendly (not real-time).
