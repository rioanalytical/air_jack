ðŸ”¹ **How the U.S. Credit Score System Works**

---

## 1. What is a Credit Score?

A credit score is a 3-digit number (typically between 300 and 850) that represents your creditworthiness â€” essentially how likely you are to repay borrowed money.

## 2. Major Credit Bureaus

There are three main credit reporting agencies in the U.S.:

- Experian
- Equifax
- TransUnion

Each bureau maintains a credit report and calculates scores based on your financial history.

## 3. Common Credit Scoring Models

- **FICO Score**: Used by ~90% of lenders
- **VantageScore**: Developed by the 3 credit bureaus as an alternative

Both use similar scales:

| Score Range | Rating      |
|-------------|-------------|
| 800â€“850     | Exceptional |
| 740â€“799     | Very Good   |
| 670â€“739     | Good        |
| 580â€“669     | Fair        |
| 300â€“579     | Poor        |

## 4. What Factors Affect the Credit Score?

| Factor                        | Weight (FICO) | Explanation                                                      |
|-------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Payment History**           | 35%           | On-time vs. late payments                                       |
| **Credit Utilization**        | 30%           | How much of your available credit you are using                  |
| **Length of Credit History**  | 15%           | Older accounts boost score                                       |
| **New Credit/Inquiries**      | 10%           | Applying for new credit too often can lower your score           |
| **Credit Mix**                | 10%           | Having both revolving (credit cards) and installment (loans) helps |

## 5. How It's Used in Lending

When you apply for a loan, mortgage, or credit card, lenders check your credit score and report to assess:

- Whether to approve your application
- What interest rate to offer
- What credit limit to assign

Lower scores may result in:

- Higher interest rates
- Smaller loan amounts
- Denial of credit

## 6. Building and Maintaining Credit

To build a good credit score:

- Pay bills on time
- Keep credit utilization low (ideally <30%)
- Donâ€™t close old accounts unnecessarily
- Avoid excessive credit inquiries
- Maintain a mix of credit types
