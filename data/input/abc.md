one of the most dangerous forms is synthetic identity fraud. This isn’t your typical stolen credit card scam. Here, fraudsters combine real and fake information—like a legitimate Social Security Number paired with a made-up name—to create new, believable identities. These ‘synthetic’ profiles often slip through traditional checks, making them hard to detect and costly to ignore.

At Morgan Stanley, we’re committed to staying ahead of such threats. And that’s where you come in.

Your challenge is to build an end-to-end fraud detection pipeline using Dataiku DSS. We’ve provided a set of pre-generated synthetic datasets simulating real-world scenarios. Your goal? To identify which users are likely to be synthetic identities—and to build a deployed scoring pipeline that can flag these cases in real-time.



How Synthetic Identity Fraud Is Performed:
Creation of Synthetic Profiles:
Fraudsters start by blending real and fake data. For example, they may use:

A real Social Security Number (often stolen or unused, like that of a minor or deceased person)

A fake name, address, phone number, or date of birth

Establishing Credit Histories:
They use these fake identities to apply for small credit lines. Initially, they might be rejected, but eventually, some lenders approve small limits.

Building Trust Over Time:
These fake identities are nurtured like real people—paying bills on time, opening more accounts, and improving credit scores. Over months (sometimes years), these profiles appear completely legitimate.

The ‘Bust-Out’ Phase:
Once trust is high, the fraudster maxes out all credit—credit cards, loans, lines of credit—and disappears. The identity vanishes, and there’s no real person to hold accountable.
