Here are some strong feature ideas for your forged signature detection model using classical machine learning:  

### **1. Transaction-Based Features**  
These capture anomalies in transaction patterns:  
- **Transaction Amount vs. Historical Median**: Deviation of check amount from historical medians for the account.  
- **Transaction Frequency**: Number of checks issued in the last 7/30/90 days.  
- **Outlier Detection on Amount**: Z-score of transaction amount compared to past transactions.  
- **New Payee Anomaly**: Whether the payee has been paid by this account before.  
- **Geographical Distance**: Distance between check deposit location and usual transaction locations.  
- **Check Issuance vs. Account Balance**: Whether the issued amount is unusually high compared to available balance.  
- **Check Number Pattern**: Irregular sequencing in check numbers used.  

### **2. Signature Verification Features (from Pindrop Vendor Data)**  
These capture inconsistencies in signatures:  
- **Signature Match Score**: Confidence score provided by Pindrop.  
- **Handwriting Style Changes**: Variations in stroke pressure, alignment, or slant.  
- **Forgery Probability Score**: Pindrop's proprietary probability metric for forgery.  
- **Authentication History**: Number of times this account has had a questionable signature in the past.  

### **3. Behavioral Features**  
These leverage client transaction behavior:  
- **Time of Transaction vs. Usual Behavior**: Whether the check was processed at an unusual time.  
- **Transaction Day Anomaly**: Whether the check was issued on an unusual day (e.g., weekends, holidays).  
- **Recent Digital Transactions**: Whether the customer recently performed digital transactions (suggesting they typically avoid checks).  
- **Multiple Large Checks**: Number of large checks issued within a short period.  

### **4. Demographic Features**  
These help contextualize risk based on customer attributes:  
- **Age of Account Holder**: Elderly clients may be more vulnerable to forgery.  
- **Wealth Tier**: High-net-worth individuals may have a higher risk of forgery.  
- **Transaction History Duration**: Length of account transaction history.  
- **Known Trust Relationships**: Whether the payee is a known, trusted entity.

Here are more sophisticated feature engineering ideas leveraging advanced statistical methods, time-series trends, and graph-based approaches for your forged signature detection model:

1. Advanced Transaction-Based Features (Anomaly Detection & Time-Series Trends)
These capture deviations from normal check-writing behavior.

Historical Deviations & Anomalies
Dynamic Z-Score of Check Amount: Instead of a static Z-score, use a rolling window (e.g., past 90 days) to dynamically detect deviations.
Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM Score: Anomaly detection score based on unsupervised learning trained on historical transactions.
Autoencoder Reconstruction Error: Train an autoencoder on historical check amounts and use reconstruction error as an anomaly score.
Behavioral Change Metrics
Entropy of Transaction Amounts: Measures the randomness in check issuance (e.g., sudden uncharacteristic variability may indicate fraud).
Check-Issuing Frequency Change: Compare recent 30-day check issuance rate vs. long-term trend (e.g., past 1 year).
Transition Probability Matrix of Payment Methods: Build a Markov Chain model of payment methods (e.g., from wire transfers, digital payments to check usage) and flag unusual transitions.
Temporal Patterns
Time-of-Day Irregularity Score: Assign a probability score based on historical distribution of check issuance times.
Seasonal Deviation: Use Seasonal ARIMA or Holt-Winters method to model expected check issuance behavior and detect deviations.
2. Signature Verification Features (Image-Based & Statistical Analysis from Pindrop)
If raw signature data is available, use advanced processing:

Graph-Based Signature Features
Signature Graph Embedding: Convert strokes into a graph representation and extract features like edge density, node degrees, and stroke curvature.
Signature Variance Score: Measure stroke-to-stroke variations and compare against historical trends.
Deep Learning-Based Features
CNN-Based Signature Embedding Similarity: Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on genuine signatures and compute cosine similarity with the forged sample.
Transformer-Based Feature Extraction: Use Vision Transformer (ViT) or Swin Transformer to detect subtle signature alterations.
Autoencoder Anomaly Score: Train an autoencoder on genuine signatures, and use reconstruction error as a fraud likelihood score.
Stylometric Analysis
Pen Pressure Variance: Identify changes in pressure using pixel density distributions.
Stroke Order & Length Irregularities: Detect inconsistencies in stroke order using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW).
Fourier Transform of Signature Curve: Extract frequency-based features from signature contours to capture distortions.
3. Graph-Based Behavioral Features (Customer-Payee Networks)
Leveraging historical transactions to build a graph model:

Graph Topology Features
Betweenness Centrality of Payee: How central a payee is within the customer's network (sudden interactions with an unknown node can be suspicious).
Graph Embedding Distance: Use Node2Vec or GraphSAGE to compute embeddings of customer-payee relationships and detect unusual payments.
Subgraph Anomaly Detection: Use graph clustering (e.g., Louvain, HDBSCAN) to detect new subgraphs forming.
Social Trust Score
Historical Edge Weight of Payee: Compute a score based on frequency & consistency of previous transactions with a payee.
Payee Similarity Score: Cluster payees based on shared attributes and flag transactions involving out-of-cluster payees.
4. Demographic & Psychometric Risk Features (Explainable AI & Profiling)
Risk-Based Profiling Features
Cognitive Decline Proxy: For elderly clients, check for erratic behavior using inter-transaction variability.
Wealth Volatility Index: Track fluctuations in high-net-worth accounts over time to detect distress signals.
Occupation-Based Risk Score: Assign a risk score based on profession (e.g., high-profile individuals may be at greater risk of forgery).
Explainability & Adaptive Risk Modeling
SHAP Importance Drift Over Time: Track which features contribute most to predictions over time to adaptively refine the model.
Adaptive Fraud Score Weighting: Adjust fraud risk thresholds dynamically based on recent forgery incidents in similar customer segments.
5. Meta-Learning & Hybrid Model Approaches
Combining multiple weak models to build a robust fraud detection system:

Ensemble Learning with XGBoost, Random Forest, and LSTMs: Use tree-based models for structured features and an LSTM on time-series behavioral features.
Meta-Learner on Model Outputs: Train a secondary model on the outputs of multiple models to improve generalization.
Online Learning with Concept Drift Detection: Use models like Hoeffding Trees to adapt to new fraud patterns.
