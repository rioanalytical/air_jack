I want to create realistic data for a mock project. I would like to have following 
(a) Jira as in realistic world. Epic --> stories --> subtask and for each of these suitable commentary in form of comments etc. 
(b) Outlook email. Email conversations amongst multiple entities with this mail DL being the project specific email (trans_mon_prj@acorp.com) 
(c) Documents stored in SharePoint/ NAS / Folders etc : there can be design docx, BA notes, Dev Notes, PO notes, SQRs etc
(d) Zoom transcription. All zoom transcript pertaining to this specific projects are stored in a folder location to be consumed for summarisation/ extracting take aways and point of discussion 
Personas in this ecosystem : Developer, QA, PM, PO, SM, BA, BDA
Now lets first start with project definition and relevant documents to it. 
name of the project : something on the lines of multi-asset execution and post-trade platform. 
Description : on the lines of - A multi-asset execution and post-trade platform. It provides pre-trade analytics, live pricing, and allows users to authorize cash wires and access portfolio risk reporting from mobile or desktop.
Goal and objective 
The primary objective is to create a seamless user experience that integrates front-office (analytics/pricing) and back-office (cash wires/reporting) functions into a single system accessible via mobile and desktop.
• Empower Users: Provide immediate access to pre-trade analytics and live pricing to improve decision-making speed.
• Streamline Operations: Facilitate easy authorization of cash wires and access to necessary portfolio risk reporting.
• Ensure Accessibility: Deliver consistent functionality across both mobile or desktop environments.
2. Core Concepts & Innovations
• Unified Interface: A single, intuitive UI/UX design that replaces disparate systems, reducing training time and operational errors.
• Real-Time Data Flow: Ensuring live pricing is integrated directly into pre-trade analytics, providing accurate, up-to-date information at all times.
• Cross-Platform Authorization: Implementing secure, multi-factor authorization protocols for critical functions like cash wires across all supported devices (iOS, Android, Web).
3. Development Process
1. Platform Consolidation: Migrating data and functionality from legacy systems into a new, resilient cloud-native architecture.
2. API Development: Building robust APIs to ensure smooth communication between the analytics, pricing, and reporting modules.
3. Security Integration: Implementing stringent security measures, particularly around the authorization of cash wires and access to sensitive risk data.
4. Success Metrics
• Efficiency: A quantifiable reduction in time spent moving between different systems to complete a single workflow.
• User Adoption: High adoption rate across both desktop and mobile user bases.
• Transaction Speed: Faster execution and post-trade processing times compared to legacy platforms.
Would you like me to elaborate on the technical stack required to build a platform like this?
now on this lines create documents design docx, BA notes, Dev Notes, PO notes, SQRs and many more which an actual project may need
