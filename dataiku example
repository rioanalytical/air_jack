Fraud Detection for Online Transactions
Problem Statement:
A fintech company is facing increasing fraudulent transactions and wants to improve its fraud detection mechanism. Your task is to build a machine learning model that can classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate using historical transaction data.

Dataset:
You will receive a dataset containing transaction details such as:

Transaction ID

Amount

Timestamp

Payment Method

User Account Age

Location (IP-based)

Previous Fraud Flags

Objective:

Build a fraud detection model using classification techniques.

Leverage Dataiku AutoML or build a custom model using Python or SQL recipes.

Ensure high precision & recall to minimize false positives and false negatives.

Deploy the model as a scoring pipeline for real-time or batch predictions.

Expected Deliverables:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends & patterns.

Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features for the model.

ML Model: Train & evaluate a classification model (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).

Scoring Pipeline: Deploy the model in Dataiku for batch scoring.

Insights & Reporting: Generate a dashboard highlighting fraud patterns.

Time Estimate: 8 hours

2 hours: Data exploration & cleaning

2 hours: Feature engineering

2 hours: Model training & tuning

2 hours: Deployment & reporting
