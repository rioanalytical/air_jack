client trust is paramount, especially within the Wealth Management space where we manage highly sensitive, high-value accounts. Our contact centers act as a critical touchpoint for client interactions — but they’re also a target for social engineering and identity-based fraud.

Currently, the firm uses Pindrop, a vendor-based solution that leverages voice biometrics and risk signals to identify anomalies. While it's a strong first layer of defense, it doesn’t provide holistic context — such as how a client typically behaves, what their financial activity looks like, or the deeper semantic meaning of their conversations.

This limitation leaves a gap — a blind spot — that sophisticated fraudsters are increasingly exploiting.


  Across the industry, contact center fraud has been growing at 30–40% year over year, with attackers often exploiting weak links in client verification or voice spoofing. It's estimated that hundreds of millions are lost annually, not to mention the reputational damage and loss of trust that follow each incident.

For our high-net-worth clients, even a single breach could translate into devastating consequences — not just financial, but emotional and relational.
