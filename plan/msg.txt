I wanted to inform you all that I’ll be going on paternity leave starting 07 Nov. I have already discussed this with our managers and received their concurrence.

All of our deliverables are planned to be completed by the 7th, while still leaving us a buffer window in case we need to fix any bugs. Business deliverables are on track, and in case of any urgent need, I’ll be available to provide support.

In the meantime, please feel free to reach out to me for:

Compilation of any documents

Knowledge transfer

Drafting plans or solutions

Also, in our spare time during November, let’s try to focus on shaping MSO/Model Mon and defining the next steps.
