| Type        | Description                                                 | Characteristics                            |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Dev**     | Long-term, strategic work like new models, rules, pipelines | High value, often spans quarters           |
| **Hygiene** | Tech debt, upgrades, OSS issues, infra migration            | Non-glamorous, necessary, often time-bound |
| **Adhoc**   | Audit requests, investigation spikes                        | Reactive, deadline-driven, unpredictable   |





| Initiative                | Type    | Owner   | Due Date | Business Impact (H/M/L) | Effort Estimate (S/M/L) | Dependencies | Notes               |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Upgrade to Python 3.11    | Hygiene | DevOps  | 15-Aug   | Medium                  | M                       | Platform     | Mandatory migration |

3. Apply Scoring to Each Item
Suggested Scoring Factors:
Business Value: 1 (Low) to 5 (High)

Urgency/Deadline Criticality: 1 (Low flexibility) to 5 (Hard deadline)

Effort: 1 (High Effort) to 5 (Low Effort)

Team Fit: 1 (Needs niche skill) to 5 (Can be done by most)

Create a weighted formula:

text
Copy
Edit
Score = (0.4 * Business Value) + (0.3 * Urgency) + (0.2 * Team Fit) + (0.1 * Effort)
Sort initiatives by descending score. Hygiene and adhoc will score high on urgency; dev will score high on business value.





4. Visualize Capacity Allocation
Fix % allocations per category based on history and Q3 knowns:

Dev: 50% (focus on impact-driving projects)

Hygiene: 30% (time-boxed and non-negotiable)

Adhoc: 20% (buffer for surprise audits or fraud spikes)

Use a visual roadmap or calendar block to show when each item is slotted.
